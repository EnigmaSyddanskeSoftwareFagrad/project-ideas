# Task Management Application Using MVP Architecture

## Description:
Develop a Task Management application in C# using the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. This application will allow users to create, edit, and organize tasks with features like setting deadlines, priorities, and categorization. The MVP architecture will help in clearly separating the user interface, business logic, and data models, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Understanding MVP Components:
- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. It handles tasks like data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. For this project, the Model will manage tasks, deadlines, and priorities.
- **View:** The user interface of the application. It displays data (tasks, deadlines, etc.) to the user and captures user inputs. The View is responsible only for the visual representation and user interactions.
- **Presenter:** Serves as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It retrieves data from the Model and formats it for the View. The Presenter also handles user inputs and translates them into actions in the Model.

## Why MVP?:
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a distinct responsibility, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.
- **Improved Testability:** The separation allows for more straightforward unit testing, especially for the business logic in the Presenter.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Changes in the UI or business logic can be made with minimal impact on other components.

## Suggested Steps of Completion:
1. Design the user interface for the task management application using Windows Forms or WPF.
2. Implement the Model to handle tasks' data and logic (CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
3. Develop the Presenter, containing the logic to interact with the Model and update the View.
4. Bind the View with the Presenter, ensuring that the user interface is updated based on the Model's data.
5. Write unit tests for the Presenter to test its functionality independently from the View.
6. Add features like filtering tasks, setting priorities, and categorizing tasks.
7. Implement data persistence, possibly using a local database or file storage.

## Project Extensions:
- Add synchronization with cloud storage for task data.
- Implement user authentication and multi-user support.
- Create different views for daily, weekly, and monthly tasks.
- Develop a notification system for upcoming deadlines and reminders.

## Considerations:
- Focus on adhering to the MVP pattern throughout development.
- Ensure the application is user-friendly with a clean and intuitive interface.
- Document the design choices and structure of the MVP components.
