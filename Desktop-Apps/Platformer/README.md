# 2D Platformer Game
## Description:
Create a classic 2D platformer game reminiscent of early console games. The game will feature a main character that players can control to jump over obstacles, avoid enemies, and collect items. Each level will have different themes and increase in difficulty. Implement features like double jump, checkpoints, and an end-of-level boss.

## Skills Learned:

- Game Physics: Understanding and applying basic physics for movements and jumps.
- Sprite Animation: Creating and managing sprite sheets for character and enemy animations.
- Level Design: Designing engaging and challenging levels with Tiled Map Editor or a similar tool.
- Collision Detection: Implementing collision detection to handle interactions between the character, enemies, items, and the environment.
- Sound Integration: Adding background music and sound effects for actions and events.

## Suggested Steps of Completion:

- Design your main character and enemies with basic animations (walking, jumping, attacking).
- Create a tileset and design the first level using a map editor.
- Implement character controls and basic physics for movement and jumping.
- Add collision detection to handle interactions with the level and enemies.
- Program enemy behaviors and incorporate power-ups or collectibles.
- Develop a scoring system and lives/health for the character.
- Design additional levels with increasing complexity.
- Add audio elements and fine-tune the user interface and game menus.
