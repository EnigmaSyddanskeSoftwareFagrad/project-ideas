## Riotgames-API: strategic map planner.
description: Hello fellow gamers. If you like games made by riot games, you are in luck because gaming community scrapes data from them all the time for you to use. Riot games have an API site, that you can access using their developer portal https://developer.riotgames.com/apis, it only requires you to log-in and you can fetch all the latest information about the game.
All of the games by Riotgames have maps included and entities that can be placed on the maps. 
Valorant has agents that shoot in maps, League of Legends have champions that battle in summoners rift, Team Fight Tactics have champions in strategic positions to autonomously battle. 
Position of the entities in these maps are paramount for strategic play, so let's create an analysis board. 
The analysis board should be able to:
    - Select a map (if appropriate)'
    - Display the map
    - Add champions on map
    - Be able to relocate champions on the map
    - Draw on the map.
    -  

skillset: 
    - UI-framework/front-end
    - Experience with APIs
    - 3-layered architecture
    - Complex state handling
    - Version control
    - Programming

Suggested steps of completion: 
    - Experiment with the API's
    - Find a framework/tech stack
    - Design the application
    - Sketch out a design
    - Implement controllers
    - Implement API layer
    - Build a front end
    - Connect all the components
