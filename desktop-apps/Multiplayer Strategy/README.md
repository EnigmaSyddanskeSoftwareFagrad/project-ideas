# Multiplayer Strategy Game
## Description:
Develop a turn-based strategy game where players can compete against each other online. The game will involve tactical movement of units on a grid-based map, capturing objectives, and defeating opponents' units. Each unit type should have unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Implement different terrain types that affect movement and combat.

## Skills Learned:

- Networking for Multiplayer Gameplay: Implementing client-server architecture for online multiplayer.
- Turn-based Mechanics: Creating systems for turn-taking, actions, and movements within a turn.
- AI for Single-Player Mode: Developing AI for opponents in single-player campaigns or practice matches.
- Game Balancing: Balancing unit types, abilities, and map design for a fair and engaging gameplay experience.

## Suggested Steps of Completion:

- Define the game rules, unit types, and their abilities.
- Design and create the game map with a grid system.
- Develop a user interface for displaying unit information, terrain types, and available actions.
- Implement the core turn-based system for movement and combat.
- Develop the multiplayer networking component, allowing players to connect and play against each other.
- Create AI for single-player mode or practice games.
- Test the game for balance, making adjustments to unit abilities and map layouts as needed.
- Add additional features like leaderboards, player profiles, and customization options.
- Both of these projects are ambitious and will help students gain a thorough understanding of game development concepts with LibGDX, from basic mechanics to more advanced concepts like AI and networking.
