## discord bot
Description: Discord is a widely used chatting application which allows its functionality to be extended using custom made bots.
The application of a bot is authorized using tokens, which a registered user can be granted through the creation of a bot on the discord developer platform.
These bots can automate a lot of the boring, repetitive work that is usually done manually by administrators and the notoriously known *"discord mods"*
Try to automate some of their tasks by creating a script for a bot to use. <br>
The tasks to be automated are:
- Creating and managing roles
- Pinging interested parties at special events
- Writing an introduction to newly connected users through DMs,
- Timing out people who posts memes in #general!!!

skillset: 
- Security (storing tokens confidentially whilst codebase is available publicly)
- Framework engagement (Discord4J, discord.py, hikari, discord.js)
- Programming
- Structuring a three-tiered application 
    - Messages = UI
    - Bot logic = business logic
    - roles and tracked messages = persistence
- version control
    - don't save state of persistent files
    - don't reveal tokens
    - share code and collaborate!

Suggested steps of completion:
- Analyse the tasks and specify them into testable requirements
- Design the discord bot to be easily extensible and maintainable for when new features will arrive
- Complete all tasks
- Find new fancy responsibilities of the discord bot.
