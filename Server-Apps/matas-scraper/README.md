# Comprehensive Beauty Product Scraper

## Description:
Develop a sophisticated web scraper to extract extensive information about beauty products, specifically focusing on exfoliating products, from an e-commerce website like matas.dk. The goal is to scrape data such as product name, price, description, size, ingredients, customer ratings, reviews, and images. Post-extraction, implement filters to organize and analyze this data effectively.

## Skills Learned:
- Advanced Web Scraping: Deep dive into techniques for extracting a wide range of data types from web pages.
- Data Parsing and Extraction: Learn to parse complex HTML and JavaScript-rendered content to extract detailed product information.
- Data Cleaning and Formatting: Techniques to clean and format scraped data for analysis.
- Advanced Data Filtering: Implementing filters and sorting mechanisms to organize the data based on various parameters (price, rating, etc.).
- Regular Expressions: Use regex for efficient text processing and data extraction.

## Suggested Steps of Completion:
1. Analyze the structure of the target website, identifying key HTML elements that contain product information.
2. Choose a robust web scraping tool or library capable of handling dynamic content (e.g., Scrapy, Selenium).
3. Write a scraping script to extract detailed product data:
   - Product names, prices, and descriptions.
   - Extract size and ingredient information.
   - Scrape customer ratings and parse reviews.
   - Download product images and store their URLs.
4. Implement logic to navigate through product categories and handle pagination for comprehensive data collection.
5. Design a data storage solution (like a database or structured files) to save the scraped information.
6. Write scripts for data cleaning and formatting to make the data usable for analysis.
7. Develop advanced filtering capabilities to sort and organize the data based on various criteria.
8. Create a basic analysis tool or visualization to interpret the scraped data.

## Project Extensions:
- Implement a text analysis tool for customer reviews to identify common sentiments or frequently mentioned topics.
- Create a price tracker that alerts when prices drop or when new products are added to the category.
- Develop a comparative analysis feature to compare products based on multiple data points like price, rating, and ingredients.

## Considerations:
- Ensure the scraper can handle dynamically loaded content, which is common on modern e-commerce sites.
- Design the scraper to be adaptable to potential changes in the websiteâ€™s structure.
- Consider implementing caching or rate limiting to optimize the scraping process and minimize redundant requests.
